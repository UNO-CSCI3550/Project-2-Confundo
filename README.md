# CS118 Project 2

Template for for [CSCI3550 Spring 2020 Project 2](https://uno-csci3550.github.io/Project2-Confundo-Description/)

## Makefile

This provides a couple make targets for things.
By default (all target), it makes the `server` and `client` executables.

It provides a `clean` target, and `tarball` target to create the submission file as well.

You will need to modify the `Makefile` to add your userid for the `.tar.gz` turn-in at the top of the file.

## Provided Files

`server.cpp` and `client.cpp` are the entry points for the server and client part of the project.

## Wireshark dissector

For debugging purposes, you can use the wireshark dissector from `tcp.lua`. The dissector requires
at least version 1.12.6 of Wireshark with LUA support enabled.

To enable the dissector for Wireshark session, use `-X` command line option, specifying the full
path to the `tcp.lua` script:

    wireshark -X lua_script:./confundo.lua

To dissect tcpdump-recorded file, you can use `-r <pcapfile>` option. For example:

    wireshark -X lua_script:./confundo.lua -r confundo.pcap
